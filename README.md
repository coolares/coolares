Coolares is an ag-tech venture focused on reducing yield-loss in fruit orchards due to sunburn. Through our ideation and validation processes, we found that this is a growing issue that has only been exacerbated by climate change. Apple growers in Washington state lost up to 25% of their yields last year and are bracing for worse going forward.

With that problem in mind, our team set out to create a product that could improve cooling efficiency, and ultimately cut down on the growing losses these farms are seeing. We use sensors to monitor the outside temperature of fruit in real time, and once it hits a certain threshold, our technology autonomously turns on existing cooling systems. This ensures that the fruit never reaches temperatures in which they experience burning.

Right now, Growcycle is at a stage in which we are looking to commence pilot studies in real-world scenarios. We have built a prototype, and are working with Washington State University in the summer to conduct a pilot study and fine-tune our technology.
